üìå Project Overview


This project aims to build a machine learning model to detect fake news articles. By leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and supervised learning algorithms, the system classifies news articles as Fake 

or Real based on their content.



üìÇ Dataset

Description: The dataset contains labeled news articles with text and their respective labels (fake or real).



üõ†Ô∏è Features

Data Preprocessing:

  Text cleaning (removing punctuation, stop words, and special characters).
  
  Tokenization and vectorization (using TF-IDF).

  
Modeling:

 Algorithms used:
 
   Logistic Regression
   
   Naive Bayes
   
   Support Vector Machine (SVM)
   
   Random Forest Classifier
   
   K-nearest neighbors
   
   Decision Tree Classifier Model
   
   Evaluated with metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.


   
Deployment:

  Optionally deploy the model as an API for real-time predictions (e.g., using Flask).

  
üîß Technologies Used


  Programming Language: Python

  
  Libraries:
  
  pandas, numpy for data manipulation
